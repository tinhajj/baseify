The book's literary influences include Shakespeare, Thomas Carlyle, Sir Thomas
Browne and the Bible. In addition to narrative prose, Melville uses styles and
literary devices ranging from songs, poetry, and catalogs to Shakespearean stage
directions, soliloquies, and asides. In August 1850, with the manuscript perhaps
half finished, he met Nathaniel Hawthorne and was deeply impressed by his Mosses
from an Old Manse, which he compared to Shakespeare in its cosmic ambitions.
This encounter may have inspired him to revise and deepen Moby-Dick, which is
dedicated to Hawthorne, "in token of my admiration for his genius".
